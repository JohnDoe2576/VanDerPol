# Neural Network based Model Reference Control of forced Van Der Pol oscillator
Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) are an exclusively nonlinear phenomenon which is often considered unnecessary in many engineering systems. Thermoacoustic Instability and Aeroacoustics are phenomena characterized by LCOs, and extensively researched by the Aerospace community particularly to keep them in check. However, 
Limit Cycle Oscillatons (LCOs) are exclusively nonlinear phenomenon which is often considered unnecessary in many engineering systems, and hence need to be controlled. Thermoacoustic (or Combustion) Instability and Aeroacousctics are some of the extensively investigated phenomena that are characterized by LCOs. Van Der Pol oscillator is one of the simplest systems to exhibit LCOs.
